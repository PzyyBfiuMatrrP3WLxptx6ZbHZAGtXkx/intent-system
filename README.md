# intent-system / `intent-cli`

`intent-cli` is **deterministic support tooling** for running an intent-driven
development workflow on top of GitHub. It helps you organize intents, prepare
and publish Child Issue Contracts, drive implementation and review loops, and
recover when a loop looks wrong — all through explicit, inspectable commands.

> `intent-cli` never launches Claude, Codex, or any other AI provider. It emits
> guidance, validates contracts, and performs bounded GitHub/metadata
> transitions. The AI agent (you, or your coding assistant) stays in the driver's
> seat and **asks `intent-cli` what to do next**.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

You need a **.NET 10 SDK** (`dotnet --version` should report `10.x`).

```bash
dotnet tool install -g JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli
```

If `intent-cli` is not found after install, add `~/.dotnet/tools` (macOS/Linux)
or `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools` (Windows) to your `PATH`.

No .NET SDK? The npm entry point provides the same self-contained release
binary through the matching optional platform package:

```bash
npm install -g intent-system
intent-cli --version
npx intent-system guide onboarding
```

See the [npm distribution guide](docs/en/13-npm-distribution.md) for npx
guidance, checksums, release gating, and coexistence with the .NET tool.

> No .NET SDK? See **[Install without a .NET SDK](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/main/docs/en/01-install.md#install-without-a-net-sdk)**
> for self-contained binaries. Need the preview channel? See the
> **[developer reference](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/main/docs/en/09-developer-reference.md#preview-install)**.

> **Linux ARM64 (aarch64) users:** Self-contained `intent-cli` binaries for
> `linux-arm64` are published as workflow artifacts from the
> [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/releases).
> These binaries bundle the .NET runtime and run without any .NET SDK or
> runtime installed on the target machine. Download the `intent-cli-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
> artifact, extract, and run `./intent-cli --version` to verify.

### 2. Verify

```bash
intent-cli --version
```

### 3. Start with an AI agent

Choose your onboarding pattern **before** making any files. Where will host
metadata live, and are you starting a new project or adding intent-cli to one?

| Host metadata | Brand-new project | Existing project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Separate host repository | [Separate host × brand-new](docs/en/02b-separate-host-brand-new.md) | [Separate host × existing](docs/en/02c-separate-host-existing.md) |
| Same repository, metadata branch | [Same repo × brand-new](docs/en/02d-same-repo-brand-new.md) | [Same repo × existing](docs/en/02e-same-repo-existing.md) |

Each pattern is self-contained and gives two paste-ready initial prompts: prefer
`herdr-only` for a collocated single-machine team because it has fewer
dependencies, or choose supported, non-retired `agmsg` + herdr for a
distributed/multi-machine team or an existing agmsg investment. Record the
choice with `intent-cli session-layer set`; the **four-thread model**, not a
transport, is primary.

**Timer-loop alternative:**

> Set up a child implementation loop for `<owner>/<repo>`.
> Ask intent-cli for the next step.

**Grill a topic (persistent interview mode):**

> Grill `<topic>` with intent-cli.
> Keep asking me one question at a time until the intent is packet-ready.

**Stack the backlog (create packets, publish the first issue):**

> Stack the available packets for `<owner>/<repo>` with intent-cli.
> Create the ready packets and publish only the first issue.

**Ask what to do next:**

> intent-cli に聞いて、次に何をしたらいいか教えてください。
> (Ask intent-cli `next` to recommend the right design-side process.)

**Inspect the real product (evidence-backed observation):**

> Inspect `<target>` with intent-cli.
> Observe the real behavior, separate evidence from inference, and propose packet candidates.

The agent runs `intent-cli` commands internally and brings back questions or
results. You focus on intent, priorities, and approval decisions. In **grill**
mode (`intent-cli grill`) the thread stays persistent — it builds an
open-question backlog and keeps asking one question at a time, continuing after
each answer until a stop condition is reached.

  organization, packet/issue creation, implementation & review loop setup, recovery.

- **Developer reference:** [`docs/en/09-developer-reference.md`](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/main/docs/en/09-developer-reference.md)
  — packaged invocation smoke test, preview channel, version flow.
- **Agent-message orchestration:** [`docs/en/12-agent-message-orchestration.md`](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/main/docs/en/12-agent-message-orchestration.md)
  — the primary four-thread model and its supported transport choices (日本語: [`docs/ja/12`](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/main/docs/ja/12-agent-message-orchestration.md)).

> **The four-thread model is the primary way to run intent-cli.** A
> **design** thread authors intent and packets; an **orchestrator** thread
> moves ready packets through the workflow and paces the loopless
> **implementation** and **review** threads over a local message bus (agmsg)
> instead of independent timers. The steady state is message-driven —
> implementation/review replies wake the orchestrator, so routine fast polling
> is not required — with a 30-minute-class design-thread watchdog loop as the
> recommended default safety net; an explicit orchestrator timer remains
> supported only as a fallback/legacy polling option. It covers
> single/multi-domain routing, next-slice publication, CI wait, dependency
> planning, a safe stale-thread health check, and safe-repair vs escalation.
> agmsg is a signal layer only — intent-cli and GitHub stay authoritative.
> This is the practiced, maintained model (still being hardened in places).
>
> **Timer loops remain a fully supported, simpler alternative:** implementation
> and review run as independent timer loops with no orchestrator thread
> required. Exactly one mode applies per domain/repo — never mix the two for
> the same domain/repo.
